# Terminology

- 'Entropy network' - the set of entropy 'validators'. 
- ['Entropy chain'](Validators#the-entropy-chain-src-api) - an application blockchain built with [Substrate](https://substrate.io), with the purpose of coordinating distributed signing.
- Every ['validator'](Validators) runs both a 'Entropy Chain Node' and 'Threshold Server'.
- ['Threshold server'](Validators#the-threshold-signature-server-src-api) - an instance of the entropy [threshold signature server](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-core/tree/master/crates/threshold-signature-server). This consists of the 'signing client' which performs the threshold signing protocol, an encrypted key-value store for key shares, the execution of 'programs', and an HTTP api for communication with users, with the entropy chain node, and with other threshold servers. The threshold server also has an account for submitting transactions to the Entropy chain. 
- 'Signing committee' - a set of Threshold Servers who have been selected to participate in signing.
- ['Programs'](UploadPrograms) - the logic defining under what conditions a Threshold Server should participate in signing a particular transaction or message. Programs are compiled WebAssembly blobs that are uploaded to the blockchain, and may be updated.
- 'Deploy Key' - Key used to deploy a program that can be used to remove a program
- 'Program Modification Account' - the account on the Entropy chain which may update the programs for a particular user / organization / entity.
- 'Signing Key' - the acocunt on the Entropy chain that is used to initate signing requests
- ['Signing subgroup' or 'Partition'](SigningGroupSelection) - a set of Threshold servers which all hold identical keyshares. The Entropy chain is responsible for assigning new Threshold Servers to a subgroup.
- 'User' - here refers whoever is using the Entropy network to sign transactions or messages. This may be an individual, organisation or some other entity.
- 'Program Developer' - here refers whoever is using the Entropy network to build and deploy programs.
- 'Threshold Server Signing account' - the Entropy chain account IDs for the threshold servers.
- Be aware that the term 'transaction' can refer to both transactions submitted to the Entropy chain and transactions intended for signing by the Entropy network.
