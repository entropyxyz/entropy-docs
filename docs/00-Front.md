# Entropy Documentation

This documentation describes the key components of Entropy, with links to source code and API documentation. It covers both the [software run by nodes in the Entropy network](Validators), and the [Software Development Kit](SDK) for interacting with the network from 'userland'. Bear in mind things are still being built.

The [Entrosplainer](Intro) gives a high level introduction to what Entropy is. [Terminolgy](Terminology) has definitions of terms used throughout these docs. 

For detailed documentation of individual crates/modules see [Entropy API documentation](https://docs-api-entropy-core.vercel.app)
