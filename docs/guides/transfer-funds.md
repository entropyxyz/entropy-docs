### Prerequisites

- Two Entropy accounts that you have access to, one of which needs to already have funds.
- Access to the [Polkadot.js explorer](./use-the-explorer.md)
- A Polkadot.js compatible browser wallet.

### Steps

1. Have addresses ready to go.
1. Import the addresses into the wallet.
1. Start the Polkadot explorer.
1. Select the **Accounts** dropdown and click **Accounts**.
1. Click **Send** on the account that you want to send funds _from_.
1. Select the account you want to send funds _to_ in the **send to address** dropdown.
1. Enter the number of tokens you want to send. The minimum number you can send is `10000`.
1. Click **Make Transfer**.
1. Click **Sign and Submit**.
1. Enter your password if prompted, and click **Sign the transaction**.

That's it! The transaction will take up to 6 seconds to transfer funds from one account to another.
