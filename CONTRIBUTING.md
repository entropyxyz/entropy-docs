## Creating PRs

Follow these steps to make a successful and impactful PR!

### Prerequisites

- Familiarize yourself with the docs project by reading the `README.md`.
- Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed.
- Set up a local development environment following the instructions in `README.md`. The Hugo static site generator is available for pretty much every modern OS.

### Fork the repository

1. Create a personal fork of this project on GitHub.
1. Clone your **forked** repository to your local machine.

### Create a branch

1. Create a new branch for your contribution.
1. Use a clear, descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your changes, like `feat/add-key-generation-method` or `update/signature-signing-error`

### Make Your Changes

1. Add or update documentation as needed.
1. Test your changes locally using Hugo to ensure the site renders correctly.

### Prepare your PR

1. Write clear, concise commit messages.
1. Describe _exactly_ what the commit does. For example: "Clarifies T of N signature verification method."
1. Run your markdown through a grammar and spell checker.
1. Ensure clarity and correctness of all written content.
1. If modifying technical documentation, verify technical accuracy.

### Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork.
1. Open a pull request against this repo.
1. Provide a clear description of your changes using the PR template provided (you'll see it when you make your PR).
1. Link all related issues. All PRs **must** close at least one existing issue.

### Code Review Process

1. All pull requests will undergo a thorough code review.
1. Reviewers will provide constructive feedback.
1. Be prepared to make modifications based on review comments.

## Writing the docs

You can find all the docs in the `/content` folder. This content directory is structured the same as the website. The only caveats:

1. The `docs.entropy.xyz` homepage is controlled by `./content/_index.md`.
1. Section indexes, like `docs.entropy.xyz/concepts`, are automatically generated by Hugo -- you do not need to directly edit the content of these pages. The content in the sub-pages controls the page snippets in these index pages. For example, the snippet for the **Quickstart** entry in `docs.entropy.xyz/basics` is generated from the `lead` variable within `./content/basics/quickstart.md`. If a `lead` variable does not exist, Hugo generates a snippet from the main content of a sub-page.
