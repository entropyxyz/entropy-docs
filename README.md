## Run locally

This repository uses the Docusaurus static-site-generator to build docs.entropy.xyz. To run the site locally:

1. Clone this repository and move into the new directory:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-docs
    cd entropy-docs
    ```

1. Install the dependencies for Docusaurus (pick one package manage process, do not run all three):

    ```shell
    # Using NPM
    npm install
    ```

    ```shell
    # Using PNPM
    pnpm install
    ```

    ```shell
    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

1. Run the build scripts and run a local server:

    ```shell
    # Using NPM
    npm run start
    ```

    ```shell
    # Using PNPM
    pnpm run start
    ```

    ```shell
    # Using Yarn
    yarn start
    ```

1. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
1. To stop the local server, press `CTRL` + `c` in the terminal window.

To _build_ the site but not serve it, run steps `1` and `2`, followed by `yarn build`. This will build the site and save it in `./build`.

## Information architecture

Documentation within this repository is found within the `/docs` directory. That directory is split into the following subdirectories:

```plaintext
docs
|-- basics
|-- concepts
|-- guides
`-- reference
```

**Basics**: information that everybody needs to know in order to understand, and effectivly use, Entropy.
**Concepts**: discusses ideas and concepts that everyone may not be familiar with, or things that are relevant only to Entropy and not other blockchains.
**Guides**: easy-to-understand guides that show users how to hit a specific goal, without diving into the content discussed in `/concepts`.
**Reference**: in-depth reference documentation for the CLI and SDK.
