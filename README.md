## Run locally

This repository uses the Docusaurus static-site-generator to build `docs.entropy.xyz`. To run the site locally:

1. Clone this repository and move into the new directory:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-docs
   cd entropy-docs
   ```

1. Install the dependencies for Docusaurus (pick one package manager process; do not run all three):

   ```shell
   # Using NPM
   npm install
   ```

   ```shell
   # Using PNPM
   pnpm install
   ```

   ```shell
   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

1. Run the build scripts and run a local server:

   ```shell
   # Using NPM
   npm run start
   ```

   ```shell
   # Using PNPM
   pnpm run start
   ```

   ```shell
   # Using Yarn
   yarn start
   ```

1. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
1. To stop the local server, press `CTRL` + `c` in the terminal window.

To _build_ the site but not serve it, run steps `1` and `2`, followed by `yarn build`. This will build the site and save it in `./build`.

### Deploy

Deploying the site is done from the command-line:

```shell
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

#### Troubleshooting

If the deploy doesn't work for whatever reason, try checking out to the `gh-pages` branch, pullling in the latest changes, and running the `deploy` command again:

```shell
git checkout gh-pages && git pull && checkout main && npm run start
```

## Information architecture

Documentation within this repository can be found in the `/docs` directory. That directory is split into the following subdirectories:

```plaintext
docs
|-- basics
|-- concepts
|-- guides
`-- reference
```

* **Basics**: information that everybody needs to know in order to understand, and effectivly use, Entropy.
* **Concepts**: discusses ideas and concepts that everyone may not be familiar with, or things that are relevant only to Entropy and not other blockchains.
* **Guides**: easy-to-understand guides that show users how to hit a specific goal, without diving into the content discussed in `/concepts`.
* **Reference**: in-depth reference documentation for the CLI and SDK.

## Contribute

We appreciate contributions of any size from everyone, from fixing typos to proposing substantial rewrites to aid clarity. This section briefly describes how you can contribute to our documentation in four easy steps.

### Getting started

1. [**Fork this repository**](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-docs/fork): Before making changes, you'll need to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of our repository on GitHub. This creates a copy in your own account that you can modify.
1. **Clone your fork**: Once you've forked our repository, [clone your fork to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). This will allow you to make changes locally.

### Making changes

1. **Identify your contribution**: Look through the documentation in the `docs/` directory and find areas where you can improve the content, fix typos, or add new information.
1. **Edit files**: Make the changes you'd like to see. Check out the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for any specific markdown rules you might not be aware of.

### Submitting your changes

1. **Commit your changes**: [Commit your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) with a descriptive message explaining what you modified.
1. **Push your changes**: [Push your committed changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) to your forked repository on GitHub.
1. **Create a pull request**: On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). This sends a notification to the Entropy Docs team about your proposed changes.

### Additional Tips

* **Small, focused changes**: [Break down larger contributions into smaller, more manageable pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests#write-small-prs). This makes the review process easier and faster.
* **Test your changes**: Test your changes to ensure they don't introduce any unintended consequences. In the simplest case, this just means to remember to [run your copy locally](#run-locally) to ensure your changes do what you intended.
* **Stay up-to-date**: Consider [configuring your GitHub notification settings to watch for any updates to this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) or changes to the contribution guidelines.
