This page lists useful information about the Entropy network and all available test networks (testnets).

## Mainnet

The Entropy main network (mainnet) has not been released yet. Details of mainnet will be available here shortly before launch.

## Testnet

There is one public testnet available for developers to use. This is not a production network; it will reset frequently.

### Public endpoints

```plaintext
testnet.entropy.xyz
```

### Chain details

- **Blocktime**: 6 seconds
- **Registration time**: ~30 seconds
- **Time to signature**: ~3 seconds when the network is under a light load. Further testing is needed to determine the upper limit under a heavy network load.
- **Expected reset frequency**: there is no planned reset schedule. However, this network should be treated as unstable, as resets may happen periodically. An announcement will be made on the [Entropy Discord server](https://discord.gg/zVpFC7ep) as to when a reset will occur.

### Resources

- **Block explorers**: at this time, developers should use the default Polkadot.js blockchain explorer.

## Devnet

Developer networks (devnets) are local test networks available for developer to quickly test their Entropy programs and workflows. The details of these devnets depend on how they are set up by the developer.
