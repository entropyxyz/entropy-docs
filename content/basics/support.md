This page outlines the support process for Entropy users. Since the network is still in its early stages, this process is likely to change.

## 1. Check the documentation

Before submitting an issue, search the Entropy Docs and associated resources. This seems obvious, but it's often worth throwing your question into the search bar.

## 2. Identify the issue 

- Clearly define the problem you're encountering with the Entropy network.
- Gather relevant details like error messages, logs, and steps to reproduce the issue.

## 3. Search for existing issues

- Utilize the search function within [Entropy Docs GitHub Issues](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-docs/issues) to see if your problem has already been reported.
- Look for issues with similar descriptions or error messages.
- If a relevant issue exists, check for comments or solutions and consider contributing to the existing discussion instead of creating a new issue.

## 4. Create a new issue

- If no existing issue matches your problem, [create a new issue](https://github.com/entropyxyz/entropy-docs/issues/new).
- Provide a clear and concise title for your issue.
- Follow the issue template for instructions.

## 5. Submit the issue

- Once you've completed all the details, proofread your description for clarity and conciseness.
- Submit the issue and wait for a response.

## 6. Follow up

- Monitor the issue for updates and promptly respond if we ask further questions.
- Consider mentioning the solution in the comments section of similar issues once your issue gets resolved.

## Additional tips

Be specific and transparent about the problem you're facing. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for the maintainers to diagnose and address the issue.
