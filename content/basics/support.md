This page provides guidance on how Entropy users can seek support.

## 1. Check the documentation

Before submitting an issue, make sure to search the Entropy Docs and associated resources. Although it may seem obvious, it's often helpful to search for your question using the search bar.

## 2. Identify the issue

Clearly define the problem you're experiencing with the Entropy network. Gather relevant details such as error messages, logs, and steps to reproduce the issue.

## 3. Search for existing issues

Utilize the search function within the various [Entropy GitHub repositories](https://github.com/entropyxyz) to check if your problem has already been reported. Look for issues with similar descriptions or error messages. If you find a relevant issue, check for comments or solutions and consider contributing to the existing discussion instead of creating a new issue.

## 4. Create a new issue

If there's no existing issue that matches your problem, create a new issue in the relevant repository. Make sure to provide a clear and concise title for your issue and follow the issue template for instructions. If you are unsure which repository you should leave an issue in, drop one in the [Community repo](https://github.com/entropyxyz/community), and the developer relations team will route your issue to the correct repository.

## 5. Submit the issue

After completing all the details, proofread your description for clarity and conciseness. Then, submit the issue and await a response.

## 6. Follow up

Keep an eye on the issue for updates and promptly respond if further questions are asked. Consider sharing the solution in the comments section of similar issues once your issue is resolved.

## Additional tips

Be specific and transparent about the problem you're facing. Providing detailed information will make it easier for the Entropy team to diagnose and address the issue.
